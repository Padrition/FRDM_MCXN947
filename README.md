# MicroPython and Zephyr port on FRDM-MCXN947
## Overview
[Zephyr RTOS](https://zephyrproject.org/) is an [open source](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr) real time operating system used in embedded development. It provides a kernel, file system, device drivers, firmware, high and low level API and a broad hardware support.

[MicroPython](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/) is an [open source](https://github.com/micropython/micropython) subset of Python 3 programming language that is optimized
for use on micro controllers and embedded devices.

[FRDM-MCXN947](https://www.nxp.com/design/design-center/development-boards-and-designs/general-purpose-mcus/frdm-development-board-for-mcx-n94-n54-mcus:FRDM-MCXN947) is a NPX's development board that can extend it's capabilities with extension boards.

## Development set up
In this section you will be guided on how to set up you development environment.
All the steps were tested only on Arch Linux, steps provided for other Linux distributions
and other operating systems were taken from the [official get started guide](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/getting_started/index.html)

### Zephyr
First we want to get our Zephyr development environment ready.

* ### System update
First make sure to update your system 
* ### Install dependencies
Then you will need to install development dependencies
### Arch Linux
```
sudo pacman -S git cmake ninja gperf ccache dfu-util dtc wget \
    python-pip python-setuptools python-wheel tk xz file make
```

### Fedora
```
sudo dnf group install "Development Tools" "C Development Tools and Libraries"
sudo dnf install cmake ninja-build gperf dfu-util dtc wget which \
  python3-pip python3-tkinter xz file python3-devel SDL2-devel
```

### Ubuntu
```
sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends git cmake ninja-build gperf \
  ccache dfu-util device-tree-compiler wget \
  python3-dev python3-pip python3-setuptools python3-tk python3-wheel xz-utils file \
  make gcc gcc-multilib g++-multilib libsdl2-dev libmagic1
```

**NOTE:** for other distributions, please consult your wiki page and correct package names if needed.
**NOTE**: if you do not have some of the dependencies in your package repository consider using third party package repository.

### macOS

Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):
```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

After the Homebrew installation script completes, follow the on-screen instructions to add the Homebrew installation to the path.

* On macOS running on Apple Silicon, this is achieved with:
```
(echo; echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"') >> ~/.zprofile
source ~/.zprofile
```

* On macOS running on Intel, use the command for Apple Silicon, but replace /opt/homebrew/ with /usr/local/.

Use `brew` to install the required dependencies:
```
brew install cmake ninja gperf python3 python-tk ccache qemu dtc libmagic wget openocd
```

Add the Homebrew Python folder to the path, in order to be able to execute python and pip as well python3 and pip3.
```
(echo; echo 'export PATH="'$(brew --prefix)'/opt/python/libexec/bin:$PATH"') >> ~/.zprofile
source ~/.zprofile
```

### Windows
These instructions must be run in a cmd.exe command prompt terminal window. In modern version of Windows (10 and later) it is recommended to install the Windows Terminal application from the Microsoft Store. The required commands differ on PowerShell.

These instructions rely on [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/). If Chocolatey isnâ€™t an option, you can install dependencies from their respective websites and ensure the command line tools are on your `PATH` [environment variable](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/env_vars.html#env-vars).

Install [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install)

Open a `cmd.exe` terminal window as *Administrator*. To do so, press the Windows key, type `cmd.exe`, right-click the Command Prompt search result, and choose Run as *Administrator*.

Disable global confirmation to avoid having to confirm the installation of individual programs:
```
choco feature enable -n allowGlobalConfirmation
```
Use choco to install the required dependencies:
```
choco install cmake --installargs 'ADD_CMAKE_TO_PATH=System'
choco install ninja gperf python311 git dtc-msys2 wget 7zip
```
