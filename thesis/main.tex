\kapitola{Introduction}
The world of microcontrollers and embedded devices continues to grow, and such devices become 
more common with every day. Even though they are seldom noticeable we more often might find 
ourselves surrounded by them. From home appliances, to cars, to factory machines to city-wide 
networks embedded devices reach wide and deep in our lives.

But with the growing count of embedded devices grows complexity of functions they implement. 
Hence arises a need for Operating Systems(OSs) to manage sets of complex programs and provide 
a layer of abstraction to ease development in such constrain but demanding environments.

To cover demand of an Operating System in embedded devices the Zephyr Real Time Operating 
System (RTOS) was created. Zephyr RTOS is an open-source operating system with build-in 
security and optimization for resource limited devices. Zephyr kernel supports ARM, Intel 
x86, ARC, RISC-V, Nios II, Tensilica Xtensa and large number of development boards, among 
others NXPs FRDM-MCXN947. ALso Zephyr has rich API that allows developers to write high-level 
code for embedded devices.

Writing software for embedded devices is still a complex task regardless of what underlying 
technologies are used. Writing it in a language such as C adding an additional complexity
due to need of managing program memory allocation and deallocation by hand.
Leaving unhandled memory sector could lead to memory leaks or worse opens an opportunity for
an attacker to execute malicious code on an embedded device. The consequences of such problems
become much grater when occurring in the embedded world. MicroPython is an optimized subset 
of Python 3 programming language for embedded devices. It aims to ease writing software by 
managing memory using its garbage collector system, using easy to read Python-like syntax and 
providing various modules to enable work with different peripherals. Additionally, 
MicroPython allows for code portability, meaning that code written for FRDM-MCXN947
could be ported and ran on ESP32 with minimal updates to code. 

But MicroPython does not 
support every single device straightaway -- ported versions of MicroPython are submitted to 
the MicroPython repository, by a manufacturer or an enthusiasts. Later submitted port will be 
reviewed and tested by MicroPython maintainers, which is a lengthy process, for example 
MicroPython port for Zephyr was under review for 2 years.

By combining Zephyr RTOS and MicroPython in one technological stack the best of both 
technologies could be utilized. Potential exists for developers to write highly readable,
easy-to-understand and efficient code with MicroPython that make use of various hardware 
support introduced by Zephyr RTOS. Yet the state of this development environment is not yet 
firm and have plenty of rough edges and unapparent problems that could arise during the 
process of software development.

The aim of this thesis is to construct a method for configuring the development environment 
for MicroPython, Zephyr RTOS and FRDM-MCXN947 development board, provide insight of 
compatibility challenges of both platforms and propose potential solutions for extending 
MicroPython port to Zephyr RTOS. The finding of this thesis will contribute to understanding 
of the state of both platforms and their integration, informing future developers and increasing usability of MicroPython and Zephyr.

\sekce{Goal of this thesis}
Goal of the thesis is to establish development environment and workflow for developing 
applications for embedded devices with the MicroPython Zephyr port. This work could be used
in future to ease start of application development and as a reference.

\kapitola{Background}
This chapter introduces the reader to an information about Zephyr RTOS, MicroPython and FRDM-
MCXN947 board that is needed for understanding this thesis.

\sekce{Zephyr RTOS}
Zephyr is an Operation System designed for resource-constrained and embedded 
system from simple sensors to smart industrial embedded solutions with emphasis on safety. It 
supports a broad list 
of embedded devices, development boards and peripherals. Zephyr offers extensive number of 
features and services including multi-threading, inter-thread data passing, inter-thread 
synchronization, dynamic memory allocation, interrupt service, power management, networking, file system.
Zephyr project is open-source, distributed under Apache 2.0 license and was created under 
Linux Foundation organization.\cite{zephyr1}

\podsekce{West}
West is a part of Zephyr's tool-chain used for building and configuring. West can initiate
Zephyr workspace from official upstream repository, update or change version of a local
Zephyr workspace to any version in official repository, build Zephyr application from source,
flash built application to a board.\cite{zephyr_west}

\podsekce{Kconfig}
Kconfig is Zephyr's kernel, peripheral drivers and subsystems configuration system that allow 
to configure Zephyr at a build time. Kconfig goal is to enable configuration without 
introducing changes to the source
code.

The initial board configuration can be found in \textbf{<board>\_defconfig} files. For
example configuration file for FRDM-MCXN947 is located at \textbf{boards/nxp/frdm\_mcxn947/
frdm\_mcxn947\_mcxn947\_cpu0\_defconfig}. The board configuration for NXPs' FRDM-MCXN947
is as follows:
\begin{lstlisting}[caption=FRDM-MCXN947 Kconfig configuration]
CONFIG_CONSOLE=y
CONFIG_UART_CONSOLE=y
CONFIG_SERIAL=y
CONFIG_UART_INTERRUPT_DRIVEN=y
CONFIG_GPIO=y
CONFIG_PINCTRL=y
CONFIG_ARM_MPU=y
CONFIG_HW_STACK_PROTECTION=y
CONFIG_TRUSTED_EXECUTION_SECURE=y
\end{lstlisting}

Kconfig values can be set to a \textbf{<board>\_defconfig} files, temporarily with terminal
graphical interfaces or with a \textbf{prj.conf} file at application level which overrides
the initial configuration during application build.\cite{zephyr_kconfig}

\podsekce{Devicetree}
Devicetree is a data structure to describe hardware. It is a community driven standard
that is heavily used in Zephyr project. In Zephyr devicetrees are usually build inherently 
meaning that for example FRDM-MCXN947 has a devicetree configuration \textbf{board/nxp/frdm\_mcxn947/frdm\_mcxn947\_mcxn947\_cpu0.dts}
which mainly enables peripheral devices, but includes FRDM-MCXN947 specific configuration 
from \textbf{frdm\_mcxn947.dtsi} (include file), which in turn includes 
\textbf{frdm\_mcxn947-pinctrl.dtsi} file that mostly defines pinmux groups. Additionally the 
\textbf{frdm\_mcxn947\_mcxn947\_cpu0.dts} includes \textbf{nxp\_mcxn94x.dtsi} file that 
defines memory ranges for SRAM, FLEXSPI and peripherals and includes 
\textbf{nxp\_mcxn94x\_common.dtsi} include file where most of devices including CPU, GPIO, 
CTIMER and others are defined and assigned memory ranges.\cite{devicetree_spec}

Same as Kconfig Devicetrees can be overwritten or have some specific devices configured 
differently with \textit{overlay} files, which as well needs to be placed in build directory, 
from there \textit{west} tool will use it to edit the Devicetree configuration.

\sekce{MicroPython}
MicroPython is an open-source project founded by Damien George. MicroPython is an implementation of the Python programming 
language that 
is optimized to be run on embedded and resource constraint devices. It implements 
the entire Python 3.4 syntax with some selected features from the later versions such as
\textit{async/await} from Python 3.5 , additionally on par with Python it uses garbage 
collection system for memory management. MicroPython final build include a compiler that 
compiles MicroPython code to bytecode and an runtime interpreter of the compiled bytecode.
Programs could be written directly to the MicroPython REPL(Read–eval–print loop) or be loaded
onto MicroPython host device with use of serial connection and utility programs like \textit{ampy}.


MicroPython's core development is focused on implementing and maintaining core features
of the MicroPython like Python language features, libraries, memory management and 
MicroPython interpreter. The responsibility for adapting and porting MicroPython to different
platforms lies on the community around it. Every MicroPython port introduces required 
adaptations and addresses hardware features and limitations of its platform. Consequently,
MicroPython support is not linear on all platforms, because some might lack the necessary
configuration for enabling a part of functionality or even lack reimplementation of a number of core libraries. Additionally, the slow pace of adding to source code features for various platforms 
created by the community means that
even fully functional and tested ports or features might wait for months before being reviewed.
Despite all of this, there are already many supported devices and architectures that 
MicroPython can run on. MicroPyton has additional support to be run on
operating system Zephyr RTOS and on OSes from UNIX family, as well as experimental Windows 
port.

MicroPython remains in beta-stage, hence it is a subject to possible API and code-base changes in the future.\cite{mpy_book}

\sekce{FRDM-MCXN947}
The FRDM-MCXN947 is a low-cost development board designed by NXP semiconductors. FRDM-MCXN947 
integrates Dual Arm
Cortex-M33 microcontroller, a neural processing unit, P3T1755DP I3C temperature sensor, 
TJA1057GTK/3Z CAN PHY, Ethernet PHY, SDHC circuit, RGB LED, touch pad, high-speed USB, MCU-Link debuger,
push buttons and has an option to be extended with external devices.

\podsekce{Signal Multiplexing}
FRDM-MXCN947 enables use of several functions for different pins by utilizing Signal 
Multiplexing. For example pin \textbf{P0\_10} which is an red RGB pin can use \textbf{GPIO} 
functionality directly, \textbf{FLEXCOMM} by utilizing \textbf{FC0\_P6} FLEXCOMM device,
\textbf{CTIMER} by utilizing \textbf{CT0\_MAT0} CTIMER device, and \textbf{FLEXIO} 
functionality by utilizing \textbf{FLEXIO0\_D2} device.

Only one function can be used at a time on a pin and only one pin can be assigned to a 
peripheral device. \cite{mcx_manual} 

\podsekce{LinkServer}
LinkServer is an NXP command-line utility that provides  target flashing capabilities and 
firmware updates for FRDM-MCXN947. This is typically used as a backend for flashing FRDM-MCXN947 in \textit{west} utility. \cite{link_server}

\sekce{MicroPython port to Zephyr}
While Zephyr RTOS provides a feature-packed and expandable development and system to be used
in embedded world standard development in C can be time consuming. MicroPython's Zephyr port
brings advantages of both MicroPython and Zephyr to single environment, allowing to write
hight-level Python like code and rapidly prototype and debug, while also leveraging hardware 
agnostic Zephyr APIs and wide support of
different embedded devices and their peripherals.

But despite growth in support between Zephyr and MicroPython there are still features that 
lack in the port and issues with coupling of both technologies. For a long time the 
MicroPythons' Zephyr port have been using an older versions of Zephyr and
MicroPython itself. It used MicroPython 1.19.1 and Zephyr 3.1.0 versions which both came out 
in period between May and June 2022 until September 2024. In September 2022 began work by 
Maureen Helm  to introduce a CI pipeline into MicroPython repository to ease porting 
MicroPython to latest Zephyr release. From this work emerged last MicroPython Zephyr port 
version based on MicroPython 1.24.0 and Zephyr 3.7.0.

And though MicroPython Zephyr port
already supports the MicroPython modules like socket, time, math, machine and other are 
implemented and usable in the final MicroPython build they may lack support of some 
sub-modules like machine's PWM sub-module or functionality of modules and sub-modules like
not yet implemented features of machine's I2C sub-module that do not have ability to set clock and data lines.

A MicroPython's Zephyr port is built in a same way any Zephyr application is built. A 
\textit{west} utility is used and MicroPython port to Zephyr source code as a build target.
The final build could be configured and some features or peripherals could be activated or 
deactivated with \textit{Kconfig} and a final devicetree be overwritten with devicetree 
\textit{overlays}. Then the result binary file is fleshed to a target board with \textit{west}
utility.

\sekce{Summary}
For utilizing MciroPython Zephyr port on FRDM-MCXN947 board it is needed to build MicroPython 
port as a Zephyr application, and then flash this application onto the development board, 
both operations are made with use of Zephyr's \textit{west} utility. Program flashing is made using \textit{LinkServer}.

Pre-build configuration is possible using \textit{Kconfig}, for setting what peripherals and sub-system are to be enabled or disable, and \textit{Devicetree}, for creating or updating a structured description of the underling hardware.

FRDM-MCXN947 is a programmable and extendable development board with many devices, 
peripherals and systems available.

\kapitola{Methodology}
This chapter introduces the reader to the set of tools used in this thesis and outlines a 
methodological approach.

\sekce{Zephyr development environment setup}
This section will detail the process of setting up a development environment for working with
Zephyr RTOS. The setup will be broken into several steps to provide clear and easy-to-follow 
instructions to the reader.

Firstly, the prerequisites and dependencies would be introduced along with the installation 
process. A note of warning of potential issues or of an alternatives for some dependencies 
would be provided. The reader will be briefed on purpose of the key dependencies. After the 
necessary preparation the Zephyr source code will be obtained and two methods for obtaining it
will be presented and discussed. Then the \textit{west} tool will be described in detail and
it's abilities for managing the project will be discussed. Next, the installation and use of 
the \textit{LinkServer} utility and its alternatives will be discussed. Finally, the 
development setup will be verified with a functional test on a FRDM-MCXN947 board and test 
prerequisites discussed.

\sekce{Use of MicroPython on FRDM-MCXN947}
This section will describe how to use MicroPython on FRDM-MCXN947 board. The 
\textit{LinkServer} utility will be used and aspects of it will be discussed.
The section will begin with an explanation on what are the possibilities to obtain 
MicroPython binary. Particularly, the current process of that takes place to obtain 
MicroPython binary working on FRDM-MCXN947 will be shown. After obtaining the binary it will 
be shown how to load it to the board and later how to interact with the board via tools like 
\textit{ampy} or \textit{rshell}. The section will conclude with a functional test of 
MicroPython possibilities.  

\sekce{MicroPython port to Zephyr RTOS}
The section will present an approach on how to setup and start using MicroPython's Zephyr 
port.

It will start with setting up a development environment for MicroPython. After this process 
of building a MicroPython Zephyr port will be shown with ways of how to influence the final 
build. The section will conclude with an illustrative program.

\sekce{Comparing native and Zephyr ports}
This section will compare two MicroPython builds the NXP native MicroPython implementation 
and Zephyr port focusing on availability and functionality of the built-in modules. The 
goal of this  section is to identify what modules are supported by each implementation and to 
highlight the missing features.

\sekce{Extending Zephyr Port functionality}
This section will try to extend the MicroPython's Zephyr port with modules. 

First, the process of how modules are getting added will be explained. Then how a new module
could be created, and how to add this module to the MicroPython build. Next MicroPython 
Zephyr port will be extended by modules to make it on par with NXP port. Finally, a community 
extension will be added to bring a PWM support and the board build will be configured with 
\textit{Kconfig} and \textit{Devicetree} for PWM to work.

\sekce{Creating an HTTP server of FRDM-MCXN947 with MicroPython's Zephyr port}
In this section the process and steps to create a web server for controlling the
FRDM-MCXN947 board will be discussed. The necessary configuration will be explained along
with the code for the server.
